Overview
City Explorer Starter is a website that provides details like weather, yelp reviews, places to visit etc., In labs 6 , you will be building a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. Working with a new partner each day, i will request data from  APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. .


You will have access to view the code base for the client, but will not be able to modify it in any way.

For this lab assignment, you will convert a location entered by the user into a latitude and longitude, then use those values to request weather information for that location. As your City Explorer back end progresses in labs 6 , you will use the latitude and longitude to request information from other APIs from the same search query.
